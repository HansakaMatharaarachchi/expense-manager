# Backend Development Setup

## 1. Install Dependencies

Before running the project, you need to install all the required dependencies. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install
```

## 2. Run the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will launch Vite in development mode. You should be able to access the application at `http://localhost:3000` (by default).
